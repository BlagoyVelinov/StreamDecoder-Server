# Me: Hello, if I make an intermediate backend between rtsp and the player that will play it on Flutter, can it be done in one, in the sense that when the player starts, the intermediate server also starts, or do they have to be separate and a rest connection should be used between them?

 - Very good question ‚Äî and actually this is a realistic and commonly used approach when you want to play RTSP streams in Flutter without dealing with native issues and crashes.
Let's take a look at what it means and how it can be done optimally üëá

 - The problem in brief
RTSP is an unstable protocol for mobile environments ‚Äî the connection often drops during temporary internet drops, network switching (Wi-Fi ‚ÜîÔ∏è LTE), or even when the screen is briefly turned off.
Flutter (even via VLC or ExoPlayer wrappers) cannot always recover it automatically.

### üîπ The solution: an intermediate backend (RTSP proxy / restreamer)

The idea is:

 - A backend server receives the RTSP stream,

 - restreams it to a more stable format such as HLS (HTTP Live Streaming) or WebRTC,

 - The Flutter player now receives an HLS link (or WebRTC peer stream), which is persistent and cacheable.

 ### üîπ Answering your question directly

 #### can it be done in one go ‚Äì meaning that when the player starts, the intermediate server should also be started?

 - Yes, it can, if you use:
ffmpeg_kit_flutter ‚Äì you start ffmpeg inside the application or
if the RTSP stream comes from an external source (for example, an IP camera), it is better to have a separate backend and Flutter connects to it via HTTP (REST or WebSocket).

 # Me: If this mini server is uploaded somewhere and a connection needs to be made between them, won't it still cause problems and crashes if the connection between them is bad?

Excellent question ‚Äî and yes, a completely legitimate concern üëè

 - The short answer is:
üëâ if the connection is really bad, there will be interruptions, but there will be no crashes like with a direct RTSP stream if you use HLS or WebRTC through an intermediary server.

 - Let me explain why this is so, and how to make it robust even on a weak connection:


 ### üéØ The main difference
üéØ The main difference
 - Protocol  -> RTSP (real stream) / HLS (HTTP segments) / WebRTC
 - How it works -> Permanent TCP/UDP connection between the client and the camera! /  Small .ts files are downloaded periodically over HTTP! / Packet connection with adaptive recovery
 - In case of a short interruption -> The stream crashes instantly, the player throws an error! / The client waits and reloads the next segments ‚Äî no crash! / Automatically recovers in case of temporary drop

 ### üîπ How to make it stable on a bad connection
 #### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Use HLS over HTTP/HTTPS

This is the easiest stable option.
Even with a weak internet connection, the player will hold on.

 #### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Reduce the length of the HLS segments

Example:
-hls_time 2 means 2 second pieces.
This way the video is restored almost immediately after reconnecting.

 #### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Use adaptive quality

FFmpeg can generate several quality levels (bitrate adaptation), so that if the connection drops ‚Äî the player changes the resolution, and does not crash.

 # Me: If you can, show me with Java and Spring + ffmpeg how to make a backend so that my video is more stable

 ### Great üëç ‚Äî this is a great start!
 - If your backend is Java + Spring Boot (Gradle) and the project is called video_player_be, we can make a mini RTSP ‚Üí HLS proxy server that will:

 - Accept an RTSP link from the Flutter application (or from Postman for testing);

 - Start an FFmpeg process that converts the RTSP stream to HLS;

 - Serve the .m3u8 and .ts files over HTTP (e.g. /streams/{id}/index.m3u8);


 ### ‚öôÔ∏è build.gradle

Add the dependencies for Spring Web and Lombok (for convenience):

plugins {
 id 'org.springframework.boot' version '3.3.2'
 id 'io.spring.dependency-management' version '1.1.5'
 id 'java'
}

group = 'com.example'
version = '1.0.0'
sourceCompatibility = '17'

repositories {
 mavenCentral()
}

dependencies {
 implementation 'org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-web'
 compileOnly 'org.projectlombok:lombok'
 annotationProcessor 'org.projectlombok:lombok'
 testImplementation 'org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-test'
}

tasks.named('test') {
 useJUnitPlatform()
}


 ### ‚öôÔ∏è application.yml
server:
  port: 8080

apps:
  streams-folder: ./streams

 ### üß† StreamService.java

Here we will start and control the FFmpeg process.

@Slf4j
@Service
public class StreamService {

    @Value("${app.streams-folder}")
    private String streamsFolder;

    public String startStream(String rtspUrl) throws IOException {
        String streamId = UUID.randomUUID().toString();
        File outputDir = new File(streamsFolder, streamId);
        if (!outputDir.exists()) {
            outputDir.mkdirs();
        }

        String outputPath = new File(outputDir, "index.m3u8").getAbsolutePath();

        // –ö–æ–º–∞–Ω–¥–∞ –∑–∞ RTSP -> HLS
        String[] command = {
                "ffmpeg",
                "-rtsp_transport", "tcp",
                "-i", rtspUrl,
                "-c:v", "copy",
                "-c:a", "aac",
                "-f", "hls",
                "-hls_time", "2",
                "-hls_list_size", "5",
                "-hls_flags", "delete_segments",
                outputPath
        };

        log.info("Starting FFmpeg process for stream: {}", streamId);
        new ProcessBuilder(command)
                .redirectErrorStream(true)
                .start();

        return streamId;
    }
}

 ### üåê StreamController.java

A REST controller that accepts an RTSP URL and returns the link for the HLS stream.

@RestController
@RequestMapping("/api/stream")
@RequiredArgsConstructor
public class StreamController {

    private final StreamService streamService;

    @Value("${server.port}")
    private int port;

    @PostMapping("/start")
    public ResponseEntity<?> startStream(@RequestParam String rtspUrl) {
        try {
            String streamId = streamService.startStream(rtspUrl);
            String streamUrl = "http://localhost:" + port + "/streams/" + streamId + "/index.m3u8";
            return ResponseEntity.ok(streamUrl);
        } catch (IOException e) {
            return ResponseEntity.internalServerError().body(e.getMessage());
        }
    }
}

### üìÇ Allow access to HLS files

Add static resource mapping to VideoPlayerBeApplication.java:

package com.example.videoplayerbe;

import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;
import org.springframework.web.servlet.config.annotation.ResourceHandlerRegistry;
import org.springframework.web.servlet.config.annotation.WebMvcConfigurer;

@SpringBootApplication
public class VideoPlayerBeApplication {
public static void main(String[] args) {
SpringApplication.run(VideoPlayerBeApplication.class, args);
}

    @Configuration
    static class WebConfig implements WebMvcConfigurer {
        @Override
        public void addResourceHandlers(ResourceHandlerRegistry registry) {
            registry.addResourceHandler("/streams/**")
                    .addResourceLocations("file:./streams/");
        }
    }
}


### üöÄ How it works

You start the Spring Boot application:

 - ./gradlew bootRun

You send a request:

 - POST http://localhost:8080/api/stream/start?rtspUrl=rtsp://your_camera_ip/live

You get a response:

 - "http://localhost:8080/streams/8a1e24f3-3c1f-47e7-91b8-1c5d6eeb5fa0/index.m3u8"

In Flutter you simply load:

 - BetterPlayer.network("http://<your_server_ip>:8080/streams/<id>/index.m3u8");

 #### ‚úÖ Advantages

 - Much more stable streaming;

 - No crashes when temporarily losing internet;

 - Works even with multiple simultaneous streams;

 - You can easily add auto-cleaning of old streams with @Scheduled.
